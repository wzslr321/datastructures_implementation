    I'm definitely not a C++ expert, so the code is probably messy and inconsistent - 
    forgive me for that 😅

<p>
    I'm on the beginning of my algorithms and datastructures journey - I'm aware that my 
    implementations may not be perfect. I'd be grateful for any advice on how to improve current code.

    If you spot some awful code, which should be changed - always feel free to contact me
    on Discord  <b> Creatix#8736 </b>.
    I love to listen to smart things from smart people!
